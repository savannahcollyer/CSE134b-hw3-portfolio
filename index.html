                <aside>
                    <p>I have tutored a total of 6 and (soon 7) different classes and I have learned a lot from each of them. However, I would say that CSE 100 was my favorite class to tutor because it gives students the most
                        freedom in terms of how they implement their assignments. As a result, I have gotten to see so many great yet different approaches to each assignment.</p>
