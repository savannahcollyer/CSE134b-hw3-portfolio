        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p> I try to read about 4 books a month which means that I have read <em>many</em> books in my life. I really enjoy thriller books that have an unexpected plot twist at the end. 
            My  <strong>absolute favorite book</strong> that I highly reccomend is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Patient-Alex-Michaelides/dp/1250301696">The Silent Patient.</a> </p>
        <p>Other books I reccomend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Teeth-Novel-Zoje-Stage/dp/1250170753">Baby Teeth</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plot-Jean-Hanff-Korelitz/dp/125079076X">The Plot</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Thing-He-Told-Me/dp/1501171348">The Last Thing He Told Me</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Were-Liars-Lockhart/dp/038574126X">We Were Liarrs</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to novels I also really like to read poetry and have even written a few of my own poems. The poem below is one of my favorites because it is so simple yet so comforting.</p>

            The Orange

            At lunchtime I bought a huge orange—
            The size of it made us all laugh.
            I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave—
            They got quarters and I had a half.

            And that orange, it made me so happy,
            As ordinary things often do
            Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.
            This is peace and contentment. It’s new.

            The rest of the day was quite easy.
            I did all the jobs on my list
            And enjoyed them and had some time over.
            I love you. I’m glad I exist.

        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>When I was younger, my dad had 6 signature meals he used to make for my siblings and I. I used to sit in the kitchen and watch him while he'd teach me how to chop certain 
            vegetables and what spices should be used in which meals. Since I left home for college, I have perfected my dad's signature recipes and have tried to recreate at least one new 
            recipe every week. My favorite kind of foods to make are soups because I feel like nothing is more comforting than homemade soup on a cold day.</p>
        <p>My favorite recipes I've tried:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021277-sheet-pan-baked-feta-with-broccolini-tomatoes-and-lemon3">Feta and Veggies Sheet Pan</a></li>

        <h2>Pets</h2>
        <p>At home I have 5 dogs: a Golden Retriever named Leo, a Border Collie named Hope, a Chihuhua mix named Ebby, a Chihuhua mix named Lily, and a Chiweenie named Kojak. I love to take my dogs
            out on walks, hikes, and teach them new tricks. Even though you shouldn't pick favorites with pets, Kojak is and always will be the best animal I've ever had. He was born with a genetic 
            condition that made him bald and have very few teeth. He loves to cuddle, sleep, and wear some of his favorite clothes.
        </p>
        <p>This is Kojak! :)</p>
